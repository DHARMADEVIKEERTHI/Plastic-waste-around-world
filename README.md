# Plastic-waste-around-world

This dataset provides information on plastic waste production, recycling rates, and the potential coastal impact across 165 countries for the year 2023.

**Column Description:** 
Country: Name of the country.
Total_Plastic_Waste_MT: Total plastic waste generated, measured in million tonnes (MT).
Main_Sources: Primary sources of plastic waste (e.g., food packaging, consumer goods, automotive packaging).
Recycling_Rate: The recycling rate of plastic waste in each country, represented as a percentage.
Per_Capita_Waste_KG: Average plastic waste generated per capita, measured in kilograms (KG).
Coastal_Waste_Risk: Level of risk posed by plastic waste to coastal areas, categorized as High, Medium, or Low.

**Understanding:** I am explaining this as supervised learning(Classification) based on recycling_rates and coastal_waste_risk.

Depending Variable: In the dataset we focusing on Coastal_waste_risk column.
Independent Variable: Other factors like Country, Total_plastic_waste_MT, Main_Sources, Recycling_Rate, Per_capita_waste_KG
