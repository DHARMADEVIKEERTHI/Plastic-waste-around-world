# Plastic-waste-around-world

This dataset provides information on plastic waste production, recycling rates, and the potential coastal impact across 165 countries for the year 2023.

I get the dataset on Kaggle of this link https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prajwaldongre/global-plastic-waste-2023-a-country-wise-analysis

**Column Description:** 
1. Country: Name of the country.
   
2. Total_Plastic_Waste_MT: Total plastic waste generated, measured in million tonnes (MT).

3. Main_Sources: Primary sources of plastic waste (e.g., food packaging, consumer goods, automotive packaging).

4. Recycling_Rate: The recycling rate of plastic waste in each country, represented as a percentage.

5. Per_Capita_Waste_KG: Average plastic waste generated per capita, measured in kilograms (KG).

6. Coastal_Waste_Risk: Level of risk posed by plastic waste to coastal areas, categorized as High, Medium, or Low.

**Understanding:** I am explaining this as supervised learning(Classification) based on recycling_rate and coastal_waste_risk. Otherwise It has Unsupervised Learning.

**Depending Variable:** In the dataset we focusing on Coastal_waste_risk column and Recycling_rate.
Independent Variable: Other factors like Country, Total_plastic_waste_MT, Main_Sources, Per_capita_waste_KG
